- Currently outlined tasks and agents to use
- Issue in that there are few open-source EHR (Electronic Health Record) datasets
- Ideally we would incorporate a generative model into the agent pipeline
- Custom-build health records with ICD disease codes and various biomarkers
- Ideally the method to train the generative model would leverage an existing model
- Maybe incorporate data synthesis into agentic pipeline
